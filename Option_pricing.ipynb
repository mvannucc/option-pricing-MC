    "# 1. Introduction to Monte Carlo Methods\n",
    "Monte Carlo (MC) methods are a class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. The core idea is to simulate a large number of possible paths for the underlying asset's price and then compute the expected payoff of the option under these scenarios. This expected payoff is then discounted back to the present value using the risk-free rate, providing an estimate of the option's price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo methods for option pricing are highly flexible and effective in handling complex, high-dimensional, and path-dependent contracts with minimal modeling effort. Their accuracy improves with more simulations, but they can be computationally intensive for low-dimensional problems and may converge slowly compared to analytical or PDE-based methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general formula for the value of an option using MC simulation under the risk-neutral measure $\\mathbb{Q}$ is:\n",
    "\n",

    "- $T$ is the time to maturity,\n",
    "- $\\mathbb{E}^\\mathbb{Q}$ denotes the expectation under the risk-neutral measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo methods are inherently based on finite sampling, meaning the estimated price is subject to statistical noise. However, the accuracy of these methods improves as the number of simulations increases, with the error typically decreasing at a rate proportional to:\n",

    "$$\n",

    "In summary, MC methods are highly adaptable and particularly effective for pricing complex derivatives involving many risk factors or path dependencies. They require relatively little modeling effort and can easily incorporate changing assumptions. However, they may be less efficient than analytical methods when such solutions are available and suitable."

The initial value $S_0$ is explicitly included as the first row to represent time zero.\n",

For at-the-money options, the price initially increases with time as the probability of expiring in the money, captured by the cumulative distribution $N(d_2)$, grows. However, as maturity extends further, the exponential discount factor $e^{−rT}$ begins to dominate and pulls the price downward. The precise location of the peak reflects this tradeoff: a higher risk-free rate accelerates discounting and shifts the maximum earlier, while higher volatility flattens the distribution and can push the maximum later or make it less distinct. \n",

On the other hand, Euler’s incorrect variance leads to a biased estimate of $\\mathbb{P}(S_T \\ge K)$. For the European call, however, the expected payoff is sensitive not only to mean and variance but also to higher moments of the distribution. While Milstein has weak order 1, the error from a single large step introduces a bias of order $\\mathcal{O}(1)$, which is significant for this type of payoff.

    "# 8. Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "This project examined the use of Monte Carlo methods for pricing European and binary call options under the risk-neutral measure, by simulating the dynamics of the underlying stock using various numerical schemes. It began with an overview of Monte Carlo techniques and their relevance in option pricing, followed by the implementation of three methods for generating terminal stock prices: the Euler–Maruyama discretization, the Milstein scheme, and the exact closed-form solution. A convergence study was also conducted for the Euler and Milstein schemes, confirming that both share the same weak convergence order of 1, while the Milstein method exhibits superior strong convergence (order 1 compared to 0.5 for Euler).\n",
    "\n",
    "The characteristics and payoff structures of European and binary call options were then reviewed, along with their analytical pricing formulas under the Black–Scholes framework. The results produced by the three numerical schemes were validated by examining the relative difference between Monte Carlo and Black–Scholes values, as well as the outcomes of $t$-tests. With all parameters held constant, all methods yielded highly accurate and consistent results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the sensitivity analysis, the key parameters — volatility $\\sigma$, risk‐free rate $r$, time to expiry $T$, spot price $S_0$, strike price $K$, as well as the number of simulations, and the number of time steps — were varied individually to examine their influence on option prices. To assess the methods performance, the option value obtained using them was compared to the Black-Scholes price using both the relative price distance and the $t$-test.\n",
    "Across all parameter values, the Euler, Milstein, and closed‐form methods produced nearly identical price estimates for both European and binary options, likely due to the large number of simulations and fine time discretization. Although the Milstein scheme is theoretically more accurate in terms of path approximation, this improvement did not manifest in the pricing results, as pathwise errors were not analyzed. Similarly, the closed‐form method, which provides an exact solution to the stochastic differential equation, is expected to offer the least bias; however, no clear advantage was observed under the tested conditions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Asymptotic behaviors were then examined, with particular attention to the limiting behavior of option prices rather than the performance of the Monte Carlo methods; in these cases, only Black–Scholes values were considered. A final analysis of moneyness was conducted to investigate how pricing curves evolve with variations in the ratio $S_0/K$, observing that the option price could either increase or decrease in the different scenarios."
